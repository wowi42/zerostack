# Publishing Releases

This guide covers the full release workflow: bumping the version, tagging, publishing to crates.io, and updating downstream package managers.

## Prerequisites

- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
- `cargo publish` access — run `cargo login` once to authenticate with crates.io
- `gh` CLI (only needed for `post-release` checksum downloads)
- `makepkg` (only needed for AUR `.SRCINFO` regeneration)

## Quick start

```bash
just release patch   # 1.7.1 -> 1.7.2
just release minor   # 1.7.1 -> 1.8.0
just release major   # 1.7.1 -> 2.0.0
```

This single command handles everything up to crates.io publication. After CI finishes building the release binaries, run `just post-release` to update packaging checksums.

## What `just release` does

1. Verifies the working tree is clean
2. Bumps the version in `Cargo.toml`
3. Syncs the new version to all packaging files (AUR, conda, Homebrew)
4. Commits as `bump to vX.Y.Z` and pushes the current branch
5. Creates and pushes an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` — this triggers the [GitHub Actions release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml), which builds binaries for all targets
6. Runs `cargo publish` to publish the crate to crates.io

## Post-release (after CI completes)

Once the GitHub Actions release workflow has finished and all binary assets are attached to the release:

```bash
just post-release
```

This downloads the release artifacts and updates SHA256 checksums in:

- `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD`
- `packaging/conda/zerostack/meta.yaml` (source tarball)
- `packaging/conda/zerostack-bin/meta.yaml` (prebuilt binaries)
- `packaging/homebrew/zerostack.rb`

It also regenerates `packaging/aur/.SRCINFO`.

### Publishing to package registries

After `post-release`, commit the checksum updates and publish manually:

| Registry | Command |
|----------|---------|
| AUR | `cd packaging/aur && pkgctl aur publish zerostack-bin` |
| conda-forge | Submit a PR to `conda-forge/staged-recipes` |
| Homebrew | Push `packaging/homebrew/zerostack.rb` to the homebrew-tap repo |

## Standalone commands

These are useful for partial workflows or recovery:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `just sync-version` | Sync `Cargo.toml` version to packaging files (no commit) |
| `just pre-release` | Same as `sync-version` (alias used by `release`) |
| `just add-tag` | Tag the current version and push (no version bump) |
| `just remove-tag [VERSION]` | Delete a local + remote tag (interactive picker if omitted) |
| `just aur-checksums` | Update AUR checksums only |
| `just conda-source-sha256` | Update conda source tarball checksum only |
| `just conda-bin-checksums` | Update conda binary checksums only |
| `just homebrew-checksums` | Update Homebrew checksums only |
| `just aur-regen-srcinfo` | Regenerate `.SRCINFO` from `PKGBUILD` |
